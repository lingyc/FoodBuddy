#FoodBuddy

FoodBuddy lets users upload prices from supermarkey as they shop for groceries, which provide other users with the pricing information on the grocery lists they saved on the application. The application will recommend which supermarket to go to base on the pricing information in the database.

This is a two days project I completed as a student at Hackreactor.
